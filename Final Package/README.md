# gdtest package

### This package contains two classes:
1. OptimizationProblem - This gives a general implementation for solving any 2-dimensional cost function problem using gradient descent
2. GDOptProblem - This class inherits from the general optimization problem class.  It extends the parent class to minimize a specific cost function.
